# Hello, Nice to meet you!

## :speech_balloon: About Me 

✌🏾 My name is Sherreka Burton. Nice to digitally meet you! 

💖 I am a results-driven, full-stack web developer with an MBA from the University of Baltimore. I am a passionate knowledge seeker and knowledge sharer, especially on behalf of the underserved. I currently work as a ServiceNow Developer. 

👩🏾‍🏫  I am a firm believer in “If I don’t know it now, trust and believe, I will know it soon!” My main goal in life is to take complex information and demystify it for the interested, yet uninformed. :brain:

👩🏾‍🎓   My coding skill set includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Firebase, Ionic Mobile Framework, NodeJS, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, and HandlebarsJS. I also know development in the ServiceNow platform. 

👩🏾‍💻 When I'm not developing, I am either:
```

📚 Reading
🗣 Learning Spanish
🍕 Eating
🚶🏾‍♀️ Going for a walk
🛫 Traveling
📈 Learning about the stock market
